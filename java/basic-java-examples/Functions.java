    /*
        The format of a function starts with two
        words:
            public static...
        Don't try to understand why,just use them.    
        After that, you have to write the
        data type that your function is going to 
        return, could be whatever data type but
        for now we just use those that we've using for
        variables:
            int, double, boolean, String.
        for example:
            public static boolean...
        ATTENTION, If our function doesn't return a value
        we use the word "void":
            public static void...
        Then, we place the name of our function:
            public static void myFunction....
        Finally, between parenthesis we put
        AGAIN THE DATA TYPE  and AN IDENTIFIER OF THE ARGUMENT:
            public static void myFunction1(int arg1)...
            public static boolean myFunction2(double arg2)...
            public static int myFunction3(String arg3)...      
        if there are more than one argument you listed
        them separated by commas or you just put nothing
        if is a function with no arguments:
            public static String myFunction5(int arg1,double arg2, String arg3)...            
            public static double myFunction6()...   
        And finally we just place code between braces.
        One final format might be:
            public static String finalFunction(String arg1,int arg2){
                //code
            }
